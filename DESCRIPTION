Description: WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase "who is") is a query and response protocol
    that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users
    or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address
    block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other
    information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-
    readable format. The current iteration of the WHOIS protocol was drafted
    by the Internet Society, and is documented in RFC 3912. Tools are provided
    to issue query requests and process query responses.
