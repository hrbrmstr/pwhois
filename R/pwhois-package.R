#'
#' WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase "who is") is a query and response protocol
#' that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users
#' or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address
#' block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other
#' information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-
#' readable format. The current iteration of the WHOIS protocol was drafted
#' by the Internet Society, and is documented in RFC 3912. Tools are provided
#' to issue query requests and process query responses.
